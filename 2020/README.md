These are my solutions to AoC 2020, albeit a month or two late!

# Notes for the future

* **Day 4:** refactor to make the validation more concise
* **Day 7:** my solutions almost certainly can be optimized (as each relationship is given by parent -> child, rather than a tree at the beginning)
* **Day 9:** the solution to Part 1 might fail on inputs where the value we're checking happens to include exactly one copy of value / 2 in the preceding 25... so I really should fix this
* **Day 10:** There's a more efficient solution where you start from 0 and scan upwards (each problem relies on the past 3 subproblems), whereas my formulation starts from the top and goes down, but it's the same in principle
* **Day 11:** Simple brute force - maybe revisit some other time
* **Day 18:** Really happy with my part 2 solution, as it basically just uses a 1 line of code difference from part 1.
